We start with establishing a communication with AR.Drone, so that we can control it or receive navigation data/video stream. After boot process, AR.Drone is ready to receive command on port 5556, to send navigation data on 5554, and to send video stream on 5555. So what we have to do is to create a socket and bind AR.Drone's IP address and port number and send/receive data using User Datagram Protocol (UDP). So we first create a socket and bind AR.Drone's address and a port and send command via UDP.

The sample program takes two command line arguments, an IP address of AR.Drone and a text file with bunch of commands. The default IP address is 192.168.1.1 and a sample command file is attached in this page. Compile this code with lines such as gcc -o testDrone_command testDrone_command.c and execute with ./testDrone_command 192.168.1.1 takeoff_land.txt. Drone will start to rotate its propellers, but will stop before actually taking off. Note that this code was developed on Ubuntu 10.04 and we tested this code only on AR.Drone with firmware version 1.6.6 and 1.7.6. Since they do not sell AR.Drone2 in Japan yet, so we have not tested with AR.Drone2. Many people, however, reported their software works with AR.Drone2 without modification except video stream, so it should work with AR.Drone2 also.
